Abstract—Transferring policies learned in simulation to the real
world is a promising strategy for acquiring robot skills at scale.
However, sim-to-real approaches typically rely on manual design
and tuning of the task reward function as well as the simulation
physics parameters, rendering the process slow and human-labor
intensive. In this paper, we investigate using Large Language
Models (LLMs) to automate and accelerate sim-to-real design.
Our LLM-guided sim-to-real approach, DrEureka, requires only
the physics simulation for the target task and automatically
constructs suitable reward functions and domain randomization
distributions to support real-world transfer. We first demonstrate
that our approach can discover sim-to-real configurations that
are competitive with existing human-designed ones on quadruped
locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks. Then, we showcase
that our approach is capable of solving novel robot tasks, such
as quadruped balancing and walking atop a yoga ball, without
iterative manual design.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Given their internet-scale training data, large language
models (LLMs) have emerged as effective sources of common
sense priors for robotics [ 1–6]. Directly synthesizing robot
policies from LLMs is difficult because it does not explicitly
reason through the physics of the environment, however, when
a simulator is available, we can combine the impressive world
knowledge of LLMs together with the approximate physics
knowledge in the simulator to learn complex low-level skills.
Recent works have pursued this intersection and use LLMs
to synthesize reward functions [ 7–9] that can supervise robot
reinforcement learning. However, thus far, these approaches
have only been used in simulation, and transferring the policies
to the real world still requires significant manual tuning of
the simulators. In a typical process for sim-to-real policy
synthesis, human engineers must manually and iteratively
design reward functions and adjust simulation parameters until
the configurations converge to enable stable policy learning.
[10]. Thus, a natural question is whether we can additionally use
LLMs to automate the components in the sim-to-real process
that require intensive human efforts.
In this work, we propose DrEureka (Domain
Randomization Eureka), a novel algorithm that leverages
LLMs to automate reward design and domain randomization
parameter configuration simultaneously for sim-to-real transfer.
While there are many sim-to-real techniques [ 11–13], we
focus on domain randomization because we believe that it
is primed for LLMs to automate. Domain randomization
(DR) is a family of approaches that apply randomization

over a distribution of physical parameters in simulation, so
that the learned policy can be robust against perturbance
and transfers to the real world better [ 13–15]. In DR, it is
critical to select the right parameter distribution to ensure a
successful transfer [ 16, 17]. This step is often manually tuned
by humans, because it is a challenging optimization problem
that requires common sense physical reasoning (e.g., friction
is important for walking on different surfaces) and knowledge
of the robot system. These characteristics of designing DR
parameters make it an ideal problem for LLMs to tackle
because of their strong grasp of physical knowledge [ 1, 18]
and effectiveness in generating hypotheses , providing good
initializations to complex search and black-box optimization
problems in a zero-shot manner [ 9, 19–22]. In DrEureka,
we show that these two distinct capabilities of LLMs can make
them effective automated designers for DR configurations.
However, jointly optimizing for both reward functions and
domain randomization parameters requires searching in a
vast, infinite-dimensional function space, which is expensive
and inefficient for LLMs to perform. Instead, DrEureka
decomposes the optimization into three stages: an LLM first
synthesizes reward functions, then an initial policy is rolled
out in perturbed simulations to create a suitable sampling
range for physics parameters, which is finally used by the
LLM to generate valid domain randomization configurations.
Specifically, to generate the highest quality of reward functions,
we build on Eureka [ 9], a state-of-the-art LLM-based reward
design algorithm that can generate free-form, effective reward
functions in code. To make Eureka reward functions more
amenable for real-world transfer, we propose to include safety
instructions in the prompt to automatically generate reward
functions that induce safer behavior. Then, equipped with
the best reward candidate as well as the associated policy,
DrEureka constructs reward-aware physics priors (RAPP)
over environment physics parameters by evaluating the policy
on various perturbed simulation dynamics; this procedure
grounds the effective search ranges for LLM sampling of do-
main randomization configurations. Finally, the LLM receives
the reward-aware prior as context and generates several DR
distribution candidates to re-train policies more suitable for
real-world deployment. Altogether, DrEureka is a language-
model driven pipeline for sim-to-real transfer without human
intervention. A conceptual overview of the full algorithm is
shown in Figure 1.
We evaluate DrEureka on quadruped and dexterous ma-
nipulator platforms, demonstrating that our method is general

<!-- page:2 -->
Fig. 1: DrEureka takes the task and safety instruction, along with environment source code, and runs Eureka to generate a regularized
reward function and policy. Then, it tests the policy under different simulation conditions to build a reward-aware physics prior, which is
provided to the LLM to generate a set of domain randomization (DR) parameters. Finally, using the synthesized reward and DR parameters,
it trains policies for real-world deployment.
and applicable to diverse robots and tasks. Our experiments
focus on these two domains because reward design, domain
randomization, and sim-to-real reinforcement learning at large
have already established as critical components of effective
policy learning strategies within these domains [ 17, 23–29].
Naturally, there are well-tested, open-sourced simulation envi-
ronments that provide ideal testbeds for assessing DrEureka’s
capability for supervising sim-to-real transfer [ 23, 26, 30]; as
a reference point, our main comparison is with two existing
human-designed configurations [25, 30] in order to demonstrate
that DrEureka can autonomously achieve useful sim-to-
real designs. On quadruped locomotion, DrEureka-trained
policies outperform those trained with human-designed reward
functions and DR parameters by 34% in forward velocity and
20% in distance travelled across various real-world evaluation
terrains. In dexterous manipulation, DrEureka’s best policy
performs nearly 300% more in-hand cube rotations than the
human-developed policy within a fixed time period. Through
extensive ablation studies, we confirm that the components
of DrEureka are all essential to generating effective safety-
regularized reward functions. Finally, to demonstrate how
DrEureka can be used to accelerate sim-to-real on a new task,
we test DrEureka on the novel and challenging walking globe
task commonly seen in circus, where the quadruped attempts
to balance and walk on a yoga ball for as long as possible.
Trained with DrEureka, our policy can stay balanced on
a real yoga ball for minutes on diverse indoor and outdoor
terrains with minimal safety support.
In summary, our contributions are:
1) DrEureka, an LLM-guided sim-to-real algorithm that
can automatically synthesize effective reward and domain
randomization designs for sim-to-real transfer;
Fig. 2: Our quadruped locomotion, dexterous cube rotation, and walk-
ing globe tasks. Walking globe is a novel task to show DrEureka’s
capability for guiding the sim-to-real transfer of a challenging new
task without pre-existing sim-to-real configurations.
2) Extensive real world validation and analysis of
DrEureka on representative robot tasks; and
3) Demonstration on a novel, challenging task.
II. R ELATED WORK
Large Language Models for Robotics. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities as semantic
planners [ 1–3, 31], action models [ 5, 32, 33], and symbolic
programmers [2, 4, 34–41] for robotics applications. Recent
works have explored using LLMs to guide the learning of
low-level skills via reward function [ 7–9] and environment
design [ 42, 43]; however, to the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has explicitly studied whether LLMs can automate
various design aspects of the sim-to-real procedure. In this work,
we focus on the two important bottlenecks of reward design
and domain randomization and introduce a novel technique
that leverages LLMs’ capability as solution generators for
challenging optimization problems to automate sim-to-real
transfer design.

<!-- page:3 -->
Domain Randomization. To bridge the gap in physical
dynamics between the real world and its simulation counter-
part, domain randomization (DR) perturbs simulation physics
parameters, such as friction and restitution, to improve the
transferability of policies trained in simulation [ 13–15]. The
most common DR approach is to uniformly sample simulation
parameters from a fixed distribution [ 10, 14, 15, 17, 29]. To
improve upon this simple randomization strategy, some works
propose to automatically adjust the randomization distribution
based on simulation training performance [ 27, 28, 44]. Beyond
feedback from simulation, some works have sought to use
small amount of real-world policy trajectories to iteratively
calibrate the randomization distributions in simulation to better
adapt to the real world [ 45–48]. Despite progress in DR
algorithms, the form (i.e., which parameters to randomize) and
the initial sampling distributions are typically manually chosen
by practitioners with domain expertise, and these design choices
have been shown to have large effect on the downstream policy
performance [16, 49]. Our work is the first to study whether
LLMs can automatically synthesize domain randomization
configurations.
Sim-to-Real Robot Learning. Beyond domain randomiza-
tion, sim-to-real robot learning has been extensively studied in
the literature with many complementary techniques, such as
system identification [ 11, 50, 51], domain adaptation [ 52–56],
transfer learning [ 12], and many others [ 13]. These approaches
differ from domain randomization in that they assume some
interaction data with the real-world environment to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. At the intersection of sim-to-real and LLMs,
prior works have demonstrated policies synthesized in LLM-
guided simulation training environments can transfer to the
real world [ 7, 8, 42, 57]. However, aspects of the training
pipelines pertaining to the sim-to-real transfer itself are still
manually designed in these prior works. To the best of our
knowledge, ours is the first work to investigate whether LLMs
themselves can be used to guide sim-to-real transfer, and in
particular, combining automated reward design and domain
randomization for highly agile skills.
III. P ROBLEM SETTING
We formalize the sim-to-real design problem setting. In a
sim-to-real design instance, we assume a target real-world
environment and a simulation environment without a built-in
reward function or domain randomization configuration. The
goal of sim-to-real RL is to train a policy in the simulation
environment and then directly transfer it to the target real-world
environment without further training.
Mathematically, the simulation environment can be defined
as a Markov Process M = ( S, A, T), in which S is the
environment state space, A the action space, and T the
transition function. This assumption is easy to satisfy in practice,
e.g., by porting the URDF files of the robot and object models
into a simulator. For a task, we represent the true task objective
with F : Π → R, which maps a policy to a numerical value
that indicates its performance. A sim-to-real algorithm Algo
for reward design and domain randomization takes M and task
specification ltask as inputs, and outputs a reward function R
and a distribution over transition functions, T :
T , R← Algo(M, ltask) (1)
Then, a policy learning algorithm A outputs a policy
π ← A(M, T , R), (2)
which is evaluated in the unknown true MDP (i.e., the real
world environment) M ∗
f ∗ := FM ∗ (π) (3)
The goal of sim-to-real is to design P and R to maximize f ∗:
max
T ,R
FM ∗ (A(M, T , R)) (4)
Commonly, Algo is a human engineer who manually
designs T (i.e., domain randomization) and R (i.e., reward
engineering). Specifically, the simulator comes with a set of
physics parameters (e.g., mass and friction of objects) P whose
values can be set and sampled according to a distribution.
Domain randomization (DR) involves (1) selecting a set of
physics parameters {p} ⊆ P, and (2) selecting a randomization
range for each of the chosen parameters. On the other hand,
reward engineering tasks the human to write a dense reward
function code for task l, and typically involves a trial-and-error
procedure where the human observes policies trained using the
current reward to design new reward candidates [58–60].
In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, equipped with
their physical common sense priors and solution generation
capability, can guide and automate the sim-to-real design steps.
That is, Algo is a LLM that ingests task specification ltask
in natural language and M as a program, which is satisfied
in practice as simulation environments are implemented in
code. The LLM then outputs T and R as strings, which are
compiled into suitable programmatic formats for downstream
policy learning.
IV. M ETHOD
In this section, we introduce DrEureka, which uses LLMs
to automate two important bottlenecks in sim-to-real design:
reward design and domain randomization. At a high level,
DrEureka first uses the LLM to generate a reward function
that is both effective at the task and safe (Section IV-A &
IV-B), then uses the resulting simulation policy to construct a
prior distribution over randomizable parameters (Section IV-C),
and finally instructs the LLM to generate suitable domain
randomization configurations based on the prior (Section IV-D).
A. Background: Eureka Reward Design
Our reward design component builds on Eureka [9] due to its
simplicity and expressivity but introduces several improvements
to enhance its applicability for sim-to-real settings. In Eureka,
the LLM first takes the task description ltask and a summary
of the environment state and action spaces (provided by
environment code M) as input, and then samples several
reward functions as code. Each reward function candidate

<!-- page:4 -->
is evaluated by training policies via reinforcement learning
using that reward, and computing task scores F for these
policies. These scores as well as other training statistics (e.g.,
values of the reward components during training) are provided
as feedback to the LLM to iteratively evolve better reward
functions that maximize F . The final output of Eureka is the
best reward and policy pair
REureka, πEureka := Eureka(M, ltask) (5)
B. Safety Instruction
In Eureka, an implicit assumption is that the target environ-
ment M ∗ is the training simulation environment M. This
is undesirable in the sim-to-real setting because a higher
simulation score can often be achieved by over-exerting the
robot motors or learning unnatural behavior, consequently
encouraging the LLM reward candidate sampler to favor
reward functions that do not include safety terms (e.g., torque
magnitude penalty). To mitigate this problem, one approach
is post-hoc adding safety terms to REureka. But this approach
requires manually defining the safety terms and also fails to
consider how the safety terms interact with other task-relevant
components in REureka. If the scale of the safety term dominates
other terms, this approach may inadvertently induce degenerate
behavior that is overly conservative [61].
Instead, we propose to directly exploit the strong instruction-
following capability of instruction-tuned LLMs [62] and prompt
the LLM to explicitly consider including safety terms for
stability, smoothness, and desirable task-specific attributes as a
part of the language specification l:
RDrEureka, πinitial := Eureka(M, ltask + lsafety) (6)
We hypothesize that this allows the LLM to naturally balance
the weighting and potentially non-additive interactions of all
reward components, thereby enabling better real-world transfer.
See Algorithm 1 for pseudocode.

C. Reward-Aware Physics Prior
A safe reward function can regularize the policy behavior
fixing a choice of environment, but is not in itself sufficient for
sim-to-real transfer. Given RDrEureka and πinitial, how should we
prompt the LLM to generate effective domain randomization
configurations? This is a challenging problem because we do
not have access to the real-world environment M ∗ at training
time. However, we do have access to M, which comes with
default values for simulation physics parameters. Even so,
the default values themselves are not sufficient as guidance
for the LLM because they reveal no information about the
parameter scales and base ranges to sample. Simulation physical
parameters often have built-in ranges (i.e., max and min values),
but we hypothesize and validate that these ranges are too wide
and may significantly hamper policy learning [10, 16].
We introduce a simple reward aware physics prior (RAPP)
mechanism to restrict the base ranges for the LLM. At a
high level, RAPP seeks for the maximally diverse range of
environment parameters that πinitial is still performant. Our
insight is that domain randomization should be dependent
on the task reward function and customized to the policy
behavior learned without domain randomization. For instance,
randomizing frictions over too wide of a range is likely to
sample friction values that are infeasible to learn given the
reward function. In practice, for each domain randomization
parameter, RAPP computes a lower and upper bound of values
that are “feasible” for training. Specifically, we search through
a general range of potential values at varying magnitudes, and
with each value, we set it in simulation (keeping all other
parameters at default) and roll out πEureka in this modified
simulation. If the policy’s performance satisfies a pre-defined
success criterion, we deem this value as feasible for this
parameter. Given the set of all feasible values for each
parameter, our lower and upper bounds for a parameter are the
minimum and maximum feasible values. It is computationally
light since it requires only evaluating the policies under different
physics parameters and can be efficiently done in parallel.

D. LLM for Domain Randomization
Given the RAPP ranges for each DR parameter, the final
step of DrEureka instructs the LLM to generate domain
randomization configurations within the limits of the RAPP
ranges. Compare this to automatic domain randomization [ 27,
28]: they too search for parameter ranges where the policy
performs well, but they directly set the DR parameters to this
range. Instead, we use it as a guide for LLM. Our experiments
show that this performs better as the base range can be too
wide and hampers policy learning. Concretely, we provide
all randomizable parameters P and their RAPP ranges in the
LLM context and ask the LLM (1) to choose a subset of
{p} ⊆ Pto randomize and (2) determine their randomization
ranges. See Figure 3 for the actual domain randomization
prompt DrEureka uses in our experiments. In this manner,
the backbone LLM zero-shot generates several independent
DR configuration samples, T1, ...,Tm. Finally, we use RL to
train policies for each reward and DR combination, resulting
in a set of policies where
πfinal,i = A(M, Ti, RDrEureka), i= 1, ...m (7)
Unlike reward design, it is difficult to select the best DR
configuration and policy in simulation as each policy is trained
on its own DR distribution and cannot be easily compared.
Hence, we keep all m policies and report both the best and the
average performance in the real world. Finally, note that some
prior works prescribe continuously tuning the DR configuration
to adapt to improving policy capabilities over the course of
training [27, 28, 44, 46]; we find in practice that the initial DR
configurations generated by DrEureka suffice for sim-to-real
transfer in our setups without intra-training adaptation.
V. E XPERIMENTAL SETUP
Robots and Tasks. We adopt commercially available,
low-cost robots with well-supported open-sourced simulators
as our evaluation platforms. For our main experiments on
quadrupedal locomotion, we use Unitree Go1. The Go1 is a
small quadrupedal robot with 12 degrees of freedom across four
legs. Its observations include joint positions, joint velocities,
and a gravity vector in the robot’s local frame, as well as a
history of past observations and actions. We use the simulation
environment as well as the real-world controller from Margolis
et al. [25]. The task of forward locomotion is to walk forward
at 2 meters-per-second on flat terrains; while it is possible for
the robot to walk forward at a higher speed, we find 2 m/s to
strike a good balance between task difficulty and safety as our
goal is not to achieve the highest speed possible on the robot.
In the real world, we set up a 5-meter track in the lab (see
Figure 4) and measure the forward projected velocity and total
meters traveled in the track direction.
1In both Without Prior and Uninformative Prior experiments, 15 out of the
16 policies resulted in jerky and dangerous behavior, many times immediately
triggering the controller’s motor power protection fault. We count these trials
as 0m/s, 0m traveled.
Fig. 3: DrEureka prompt for generating domain randomization
parameters. The blue paragraph describes the instruction, and the
green paragraph is the reward aware parameter prior computed in
Algorithm 2.
In addition to locomotion, we validate DrEureka’s applica-
bility to a second task category of dexterous manipulation.
Here, we use the LEAP hand [ 30], which is a low-cost
anthropomorphic robot hand, featuring 16 degrees of freedom
distributed among three fingers and a thumb. The task involves
rotating a cube in-hand as many times as possible within a 20-
second interval. This task is challenging because the policy only
receives 16 joint angles and proprioceptive history, encoded
via GRU [ 63], as observations and does not have access to
the position and the pose of the cube. The policy then outputs
target joint angles as position commands to the motors.
Both robots cost less than 10K USD and admit simulators
in NVIDIA Isaac Gym [ 64] with sim-to-real training code that
has been tested in the real world.
Methods. DrEureka uses GPT-4 [ 65] as the backbone
LLM, and we use the original Eureka hyperparameters for
reward generation before sampling 16 DR configurations.
To understand the best and the average performance of
DrEureka, we train policies for all 16 configurations and
evaluate all policies in the real world. We primarily compare
to the human-designed reward function and DR configuration
from the original task implementations [ 25, 30] as reference;
We refer to this baseline as Human-Designed. Note that this
baseline for forward locomotion trains a velocity-conditioned
policy and utilizes a reward function with a velocity curriculum
that gradually increases as policy training progresses. For our
comparison, we train on the whole curriculum but evaluate the
policy at 2 m/s. We emphasize that the purpose of comparing to
Human-Designed is to determine whether DrEureka can
be useful – i.e., enabling sim-to-real transfer on a representative
robot task for which robotics researchers have devoted time

<!-- page:6 -->
to designing effective sim-to-real pipelines. The absolute
performance ordering is of less importance as LLMs and
humans arrive at their respective sim-to-real configurations
using vastly different computational and cognitive mechanisms.
To verify that a policy outputted by a reward-design
algorithm itself is not effective for real-world deployment,
we also compare against Eureka [ 9], which designs rewards
using LLMs without safety consideration and trains policies
without domain randomization.
Additionally, we consider two classes of DrEureka ab-
lations that probe (1) whether some fixed DR configuration
can generally outperform DrEureka samples, and (2) the
importance of DrEureka’s reward-aware priors (SectionIV-C)
and LLM sampling (Section IV-D). In the first class, we
first compare to an ablation that does not train with domain
randomization (No DR). Second, we consider a baseline that
trains with the human-designed DR ( Human-Designed
DR) in the original implementation. Third, we consider a
baseline that directly uses the full ranges of the RAPP
parameter priors as the DR configuration ( Prompt DR); this
ablation can be viewed as applying domain randomization
algorithms [27, 28, 44] that seek to prescribe the maximally
diverse parameter ranges where the policy performs well as the
configurations. In the second category of ablations, we consider
an ablation that only has access to the set of physics parameters
but without the reward-aware priors ( No Prior ). Additionally,
we consider an ablation that has only the default search range
for RAPP as the parameter priors ( Uninformative Prior ).
Finally, we consider a baseline that randomly samples from the
RAPP ranges ( Random Sampling); this baseline helps show
whether LLM-based sampling is a better hypothesis generator.
In all ablations, we fix the DrEureka reward function for the
task and only modify the DR configurations.
Finally, we compare DrEureka’s DR-generation with prior
methods based on Cross Entropy Method (CEM) [ 16, 66, 67]
and Bayesian Optimization (BayRn) [ 48, 68], which optimize
DR parameters by repeatedly training and evaluating policies
in real. Note that while CEM and BayRn tackle the same
problem, their iterative procedure is conceptually different
from DrEureka, which trains all policies in parallel; thus, this
comparison favors the baselines because they use additional
information from intermediate real-world evaluations. First,
we consider CEM initialized with mean at simulation default
values and variance 1 (CEM Random ), following [ 16]. Second,
we consider CEM initialized by randomly sampling within
the RAPP bounds, ( CEM RAPP ), which provides a stronger
prior. Third, we consider BayRn with parameters bounded
by RAPP and initial samples randomly drawn from RAPP
(BayRn RAPP ). Additional details are in the Appendix.
Policy Training and Evaluation. We train all policies
entirely in the simulation environment and use policy training
code framework provided by Margolis et al. [25] for forward
locomotion and Shaw et al. [30] for cube rotation. For both
tasks, the reinforcement learning algorithm is Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) [ 69]. Forward locomotion specifically
uses a teacher-student variant of PPO in which the teacher

to supervise a student policy that uses sensors available in
the real world. Adopting the evaluation protocol from Ma
et al. [9], we use the original policy training hyperparameters
for all policy training and do not modify or tune them for
DrEureka’s configurations. Therefore, the differences in
performance between DrEureka and Human-Designed
can be attributed to the different DR parameters as well
as reward functions DrEureka produces. For every DR
configuration, we train policies using 3 random seeds and
report average as well as standard deviation across trials and
seeds. Video results are included on our project website.
VI. R ESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Our experiments are designed to answer the following:
1) Can DrEureka be competitive with manual, pre-existing
Sim2Real pipeline on known tasks?
2) How important is each component of DrEureka?
3) Can DrEureka help solve challenging new tasks for
which no prior sim-to-real pipeline exists?
A. Comparison to Pre-Existing Sim-to-Real Configurations
We first directly compare DrEureka to
Human-Designed to assess whether DrEureka is
capable of providing sim-to-real training configurations
comparable to human-designed ones. For forward locomotion,
as shown in Table I, DrEureka is able to outperform
Human-Designed in terms of both forward velocity as

well as distance traveled on the track. The performance of
DrEureka is robust across its different DR sample outputs;
the average performance does not lag too far behind the
best DrEureka configuration and still performs on par
with or slightly better than Human-Designed. In contrast,
the plain Eureka generated policy fails to walk in the real
world, validating that a reward design algorithm suitable for
simulation is not sufficient for sim-to-real transfer. More
details about our experiments comparing DrEureka’s reward
against ablations can be found in the Appendix.
Similarly, for cube rotation, we see in Table II that
DrEureka outperforms Human-Designed in terms of
rotation while maintaining a competitive time-to-fall duration.
We note that this task permits very little room for error;
thus, policies generally perform very well or very badly,
resulting in the relatively larger standard deviation across
DrEureka’s policies. Nevertheless, the best policy from
DrEureka significantly outperforms the baseline by nearly
three times the rotation without dropping the cube. These results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach across
diverse robotic platforms.
Real-world robustness. One main appeal of domain ran-
domization is the robustness of the learned policies to real-
world environment perturbations. To probe whetherDrEureka
policies exhibit this capability, we test DrEureka (Best) and
Human-Designed on several additional testing environments
for forward locomotion (Figure 4). Within the lab environment,
we consider an artificial grass turf as well as putting socks on
the quadruped legs. For an outdoor environment, we test on an
empty pedestrian sidewalk; the results are shown in Figure 5.
We see that across different testing conditions, DrEureka
remains performant and consistently matches or outperforms
Human-Designed. This validates that DrEureka is capable
of producing robust policies in the real world.
Having validated that DrEureka can be as effective as
human-crafted sim-to-real designs in real-world scenarios,
we provide further analysis and perform ablations on the
quadrupedal locomotion task to better understand the sources
of its effectiveness.
B. Does DrEureka generate effective DR configurations?
DrEureka surpasses DR optimization baselines. In Table
I, we see that BayRn RAPP and CEM RAPP produce worse
final policies and are less sample efficient than DrEureka;
this is despite the fact that several random initial samples from
the RAPP range used to seed BayRn and CEM are reasonably
effective. CEM Random performs worse as well since it has
no access to the RAPP bounds, causing its variance of 1
to both overshoot and undershoot parameters. These results
show that LLM-generated DR can outperform prior feedback-
based approaches. Moreover, since these baselines are iterative,
DrEureka incurs a significantly shorter wall-clock runtime of
3 hours, compared to 10 and 20 for CEM and BayRn. Finally,
we note that DrEureka avoids testing intermediate real-world
policies that can be unsafe, especially for novel tasks like our
globe walking task which lack performant controllers.

DrEureka uses physical knowledge to construct DR
ranges. DrEureka takes advantage of the LLM’s physical
reasoning capabilities, which serve as a strong prior on DR
ranges that are reasonable and intuitive. In the Appendix,
we provide an example of the LLM output along with its
explanations. We see that the LLM chooses the lower half of
the RAPP restitution range, explaining that "restitution affects
how the robot bounces off surfaces... lower range as we’re
not focusing on bouncing." For gravity, it chooses a relatively
small range for "small tweaks to represent minor slopes or
variations the robot might need to adapt to." Thus, DrEureka
proposes more reasonable DR configurations than CEM and
BayRn, which treat DR as a numerical black-box optimization
problem and relies on noisy real-world feedback for improving
DR parameter proposal.
DrEureka outperforms all DR ablations. The real-world

from falling. For outdoor tests, we evaluate the policy across various terrains, including sidewalks, roads, grass, and wooden bridges.
evaluation of these ablations is included in Table I. We first
analyze the group of ablations that fix a single choice of
DR configuration or lack thereof. We see that our tasks
clearly demand domain randomization as No DR is inferior to
both DrEureka and Human-Designed. However, finding a
suitable DR is not trivial. Prompt DR suggests wide parameter
ranges (especially over friction as seen in Figure 3) that forces
the robot to over-exert forces; this result is validated in Figure 9
where we visualize the histogram of hip torque readings from
real-world deployment of DrEureka policies versus Prompt
DR policies. On the other hand, using Human-Designed DR
does not match the performance of DrEureka, illustrating the
importance of reward-aware domain randomization. Onto the
sampling-based baselines, the subpar performance of Random
Sampling suggests the effectiveness of LLMs as hypothesis
generators, consistent with prior works that have found LLMs
to be effective for suggesting initial samples for optimization
problems [9, 19–22]. However, fully utilizing LLM’s zero-shot
generation capability requires proper grounding of the sampling
space. No Prior and Uninformative Prior, despite using a
LLM as sampler, performs very poorly and often results in
policies that trigger safety protection power cutoff in the real
world. One common concern for LLM-based solutions is data
leakage, in which the LLM has seen the problems and solutions
for an evaluation task. In our setting, if the LLM has seen the
simulations tasks and consequently the human-designed
ranges in the open-sourced code base, then even if the priors
are withheld in the context, it should be possible to output
reasonable ranges out of the box. Fortunately, the negative
results of No Prior confirm that data leakage does not appear in
our evaluation. Altogether, these results affirm that both reward-
aware parameter priors and LLM as a hypothesis generator in
the DrEureka framework are necessary for the best real-world
performance.
C. The Walking Globe Trick
Our experiments above have focused on a thorough validation
of DrEureka on existing tasks, where a state-of-the-art sim-

to-real approach was readily available as a reference point.
Having validated DrEureka’s ability to automate sim-to-real
to comparable performance levels with human design, we
now employ DrEureka for a challenging new task. In circus
performances, the walking globe trick involves a performer
balancing on a large sphere. Inspired by this, we train our
quadruped to walk on an inflated yoga ball. The deformable
and bouncy nature of the yoga ball complicates this task
as IsaacGym simulation does not permit faithfully modeling
the resulting complex dynamics of quadruped motion on the
ball. See Figure 6 for visualizations of the simulation and the
real world environment. This is a novel and arguably more
difficult task than most solved quadrupedal tasks. Naturally,
there is no pre-existing sim-to-real reward function or domain
randomization configuration, making this task an ideal test-bed
for DrEureka’s ability to accelerate robot skill discovery.
The simulation environment is adapted from Ji et al. [70],
which simulates the Go1 playing with a small soccer ball. The
robot and the ball are allowed to move around a large plane
in simulation, but in the lab setting for safety, we limit the
robot’s movement by strapping it to a center support point in
the room that is kept at the same height as the robot’s center of
mass; we use a human as the center point (see left of Figure 6)
in order to provide support in the case of falling. The ball is
free to move within a radius of 1 meter around this point. We
perform DrEureka using the same hyperparameters as in the
locomotion task and report policy performance in Table III; we
include the DrEureka reward function and DR configurations
for this task in Appendix. We observe the quadruped staying

<!-- page:9 -->
on the ball for an average of 15.43 seconds in the real world,
many times making recovery actions to stabilize the ball and
readjust its pose. In simulation, since the policy experiences a
wide range of randomization parameters and perturbations, its
average episode length is 10.72 seconds.
Furthermore, given that the lab environment has limited
floor space, we also deploy our policy on diverse, uncontrolled
outdoor real-world scenes to further test the policy’s robustness.
With appropriate controls that limits the speed of the robot, the
policy operated effectively for over four minutes under various
conditions. Notably, the robot demonstrated stable navigation
on grass, adeptly handled transitions over height obstacles, and
moved smoothly onto sidewalks and wooden bridges. We also
tested the policy’s robustness by introducing perturbations such
as kicking the yoga ball and operating the policy as the ball
deflated. In all scenarios, the policy successfully managed these
challenges, showcasing its adaptability and robustness across
diverse operational conditions. See project website for videos.
In summary, DrEureka’s adeptness at tackling the novel
and complex task of quadrupedal globe walking showcases
its capacity to push the boundaries of what is achievable in
robotic control tasks. This feat, achieved without prior specific
sim-to-real pipelines, highlights DrEureka’s potential as a
versatile tool in accelerating the development and deployment
of robust robotic policies in the real world.
VII. C ONCLUSION
We have presented DrEureka, a novel technique for using
large language models to guide sim-to-real reinforcement
learning. Without human supervision, DrEureka can au-
tomatically generate effective reward functions and domain
randomization configurations comparable to human-crafted
ones. DrEureka is validated on quadrupedal locomotion
and dexterous manipulation, and we have shown its potential
in solving novel challenging tasks such as quadruped globe
walking. We believe that DrEureka demonstrates the potential
of accelerating robot learning research by using foundation
models to automate the difficult design aspects of low-level
skill learning.
VIII. L IMITATIONS
While DrEureka demonstrates the potential of leveraging
LLMs for automating the sim-to-real transfer process in
robotics, there are several areas of improvement to the current
implementation:
• Lack of visual inputs : The current implementation
of DrEureka does not integrate visual data from the
environment, relying instead on lower-dimensional state
representations. Incorporating vision-based inputs could
potentially improve the robustness and generalizability of
the learned policies in the real world, where visual cues
play a critical role in navigation and interaction.
• Static domain randomization parameters: In the current
framework, the domain randomization (DR) parameters,
once generated, remain fixed during policy training.
Dynamic adjustment of DR parameters based on policy
performance or real-world feedback could further improve
the sim-to-real transferability.
• Lack of policy selection mechanism : The evaluation
of DrEureka primarily focuses on the effectiveness of
the generated reward functions and DR configurations.
However, a systematic approach for selecting the most
promising policies out of the generated candidates for
real-world deployment is not explored. Integrating a
mechanism that predicts real-world efficacy based on sim-
ulation performance or other heuristics could streamline
the process of identifying the best policies for deployment.

APPENDIX
A. Full Prompts and Success Criteria
In this section, we provide DrEureka prompts used for experiments and ablations. We also include the success criteria
used to select reward candidates.
A1. Reward Generation Prompts
This section contains the system and task prompts for generating reward functions for forward locomotion and globe walking
tasks using DrEureka.
You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text.
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: {task_reward_signature_string}
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
 
Prompt 1: DrEureka system prompt for reward generation.

To make the go1 quadruped run forward with a velocity of exactly 2.0 m/s in the positive x direction of the global
coordinate frame. The policy will be trained in simulation and deployed in the real world, so the policy should be as
steady and stable as possible with minimal action rate. Specifically, as it’s running, the torso should remain near a
z position of 0.34, and the orientation should be perpendicular to gravity. Also, the legs should move smoothly and
avoid the DOF limits.
 
Prompt 2: DrEureka forward locomotion task prompt for reward generation. The safety instructions encouraging a steady torso and smooth
movement result in natural gaits.

To make the robot hand rotate the cube in hand with positive angular velocity around the z-axis as many times as possible.
We want the cube to remain in the palm with near-zero linear velocity, and it should not fall out of the hand. The
policy will be trained in simulation and deployed in the real world, so the policy should be smooth and steady, and
the fingers should be penalized for deviating far from their initial position. For safety, we would like the cube to
rotate at around 0.25 radians per second; however, it’s okay if it rotates faster.
 
Prompt 3: DrEureka cube rotation task prompt for reward generation. Note that we limit the encouraged rotation speed to 0.25 rad/s due to
simulation inaccuracies causing extreme angular velocity measurements; while the policy is not explicitly rewarded for rotating faster than
this, we find that faster rotation is implicitly rewarded by greater stability and consistency.

To make the go1 quadruped balance on the top of the ball. The quadruped should maintain a z-position of 2 * ball_radius or
higher. Please keep in mind that the policy learned using your reward terms will be deployed on a robot in the real
world. As such, you should prioritize safety, robustness, and feasibility over performance. Please generate reward
terms that penalize actions that are unsafe or infeasible. Please also penalize jittery or fast actions that may burn
out the motors. Also, remember to keep the scaling of your regularization terms small. If you choose to use env.
torques, please keep in mind that this value will be large, so your scaling for this term should be near 0.00001.
 
Prompt 4: DrEureka globe walking task prompt for reward generation. In our safety instruction, we provide a numerical value to ground
torque scaling because env.torques in the code is the output of a black-box model rather than mathematically calculated.
A2. Reward Generation Ablation Prompts
This section contains prompts used in ablation studies, specifically for generating reward functions without safety instructions
to assess the impact of such instructions on the generated rewards.
The Python environment is {environment source code}. Write a reward function for the following task: To make the go1
quadruped run forward with a velocity of exactly 2.0 m/s in the positive x direction of the global coordinate frame.
 
Prompt 5: DrEureka forward locomotion task prompt for reward generation, without safety instructions.
A3. Domain Randomization Generation Prompts
This section includes the initial system and user prompts for generating domain randomization configurations, demonstrating
how DrEureka is applied to different tasks for robust policy training.
You are a reinforcement learning engineer. Your goal is to design a set of domain randomization parameters for the given
task to facilitate successful deployment of the trained policy in the real world.
To do so, you will be given valid parameters as well as a range for each parameter that indicates the maximum and minimum
values that parameter can take. Please note that your randomization ranges do not need to cover most of the range.
Also, you should keep in mind that the more you randomize, the more difficult it will be for the policy to learn the task
within our fixed compute budget. A good policy should be trained only on randomization ranges that will help it adapt
to the real world.
You should first reason over each parameter and determine if it’s useful for domain randomization.
Then, you should output a range of values for each parameter that you think will be useful for the task in a real-world
deployment. Please explain your reasoning for each parameter.

<!-- page:14 -->
Output your response in the form of Python code that sets the parameters as variables, e.g.:
‘‘‘
friction_range = [0.0, 1.0]
‘‘‘
Please make your variable names match the parameter names provided. Each variable should be assigned a range formatted as
a Python list with two elements. Write everything else as Python comments.
 

gravity_range = [-1.0, 1.0] (This is the range of values added onto each dimension of [0.0, 0.0, -9.8].
For example, [0.0, 0.0] would keep gravity constant.)

Prompt 7: DrEureka quadruped prompt with RAPP from DrEureka policy. This prompt corresponds to the ’Our Method’ configuration
in Table I.

in Table II.

The task is to train a quadruped robot to balance on a yoga ball for as long as possible.
The robot will be trained in simulation and then deployed in the real world. Please note that our simulation environment
models the ball as a solid rigid object, so the robot will not be able to deform the ball in any way. However, our
real yoga ball is hollow, bouncy, and deformable, so the robot will need to adapt to this difference. Please keep this
in mind when designing your domain randomization.
Our parameters and valid ranges are the following:

robot_restitution_range = [0.0, 1.0]
robot_payload_mass_range = [-1.0, 5.0]

# Note: Each range is chosen with the thought of exposing the robot to a variety of conditions it might face in the real
world

B3. LLM Reward Reflection
The following is an example of reward reflection on the challenging Walking Globe task. Provided with task scores and
other training statistics, the LLM is asked to evolve better reward functions.

Eureka Output:
Here are the reward terms I am planning to implement:
1. height_reward: Encourage the agent to maintain a z-position of at least 2 * ball_radius.
2. balance_reward: Encourage the agent to balance on the ball by minimizing the distance between the feet and the top of
the ball.
3. smooth_actions_reward: Encourage smooth actions to reduce jittery or fast actions.
‘‘‘python
def _reward_height(self):
env = self.env
height_threshold = 2.0 * env.ball_radius
height_reward = torch.where(env.base_pos[:, 2] >= height_threshold, torch.ones_like(env.base_pos[:, 2]), torch.
zeros_like(env.base_pos[:, 2]))
return 1.0 * height_reward
def _reward_balance(self):
env = self.env
ball_top = env.object_pos_world_frame + torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, env.ball_radius], device=env.device).unsqueeze(0)
feet_dist_to_ball_top = torch.norm(env.foot_positions - ball_top.unsqueeze(1), dim=-1)
balance_reward = 1.0 - torch.mean(feet_dist_to_ball_top, dim=-1)
return 1.0 * balance_reward
def _reward_smooth_actions(self):
env = self.env
action_diff = env.actions - env.last_actions
smooth_actions_reward = -torch.mean(torch.abs(action_diff), dim=-1)
return 0.1 * smooth_actions_reward
‘‘‘
The height_reward motivates the agent to maintain a z-position above the threshold. The balance_reward ensures the agent
learns to balance on the ball by minimizing the distance between the feet and the top of the ball. The
smooth_actions_reward encourages the agent to take smoother actions rather than jittery or too fast actions that may
burn out the motors.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.
Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to
optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
(a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
(b) Re-writing the reward component
(c) Discarding the reward component
(3) If some reward components magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code
. The output of the reward function should be only your reward value.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "‘‘‘python ... ‘‘‘".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
(1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the
overall reward or its components
(2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the
transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input
variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
(3) Most importantly, the reward codes must only use attributes of the provided environment object (namely, variables
that have prefix env.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Eureka Output:
From the policy feedback, it seems that the reward for height (’rew height’) and balance (’rew balance’) are significant
and show improvement, but the reward for smooth actions (’rew smooth actions’) needs more optimization. I will
increase the scale for smooth_actions_reward and introduce an exponential reward component for height_reward so that
the reward gradient is smoother. Here is the updated reward function:
‘‘‘python
def _reward_height(self):
env = self.env
height_threshold = 2.0 * env.ball_radius
height_temperature = 10.0 # new temperature parameter for exponential transformation
height_exp = torch.exp((env.base_pos[:, 2] - height_threshold) / height_temperature)
height_reward = torch.where(env.base_pos[:, 2] >= height_threshold, height_exp, torch.zeros_like(env.base_pos[:, 2]))
return 2.0 * height_reward # increase scale of height_reward
def _reward_balance(self):
env = self.env
ball_top = env.object_pos_world_frame + torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, env.ball_radius], device=env.device).unsqueeze(0)
feet_dist_to_ball_top = torch.norm(env.foot_positions - ball_top.unsqueeze(1), dim=-1)
balance_reward = 1.0 - torch.mean(feet_dist_to_ball_top, dim=-1)
return 1.0 * balance_reward
def _reward_smooth_actions(self):
env = self.env
action_diff = env.actions - env.last_actions
smooth_actions_reward = -torch.mean(torch.abs(action_diff), dim=-1)
return 0.5 * smooth_actions_reward # increase scale of smooth_actions_reward
‘‘‘
In this updated reward function, I introduced a temperature parameter (‘height_temperature‘) and applied an exponential
transformation to the height_reward so that the reward gradient is smoother. I also multiplied the height_reward scale
by 2 to make it more significant. Finally, I increased the scale of the smooth_actions_reward by 0.5 to encourage
smoother actions more than before, which will help further improve the policy.

D. Experimental Setup
D1. Forward Locomotion
For the forward locomotion task, our policy takes joint positions, joint velocities, a gravity vector, and a history of past
observations and actions as input. It produces joint position commands for a PD controller, which has a proportional gain of 20
and derivative gain of 0.5.
We extend the simulation setup from Margolis et al. [25], and we include additional domain randomization parameters,
specifically joint stiffness, damping, friction, and armature that were not in the their work. These parameters, along with the
others in Table XII, were randomized during training. We chose these parameters based on IsaacGym’s documentation on rigid
body, rigid shape, and DOF properties 2.

TABLE XII: Domain randomization parameters for forward locomotion, along with their valid ranges and RAPP search ranges.
Though the scale of these parameters differs, each RAPP range is chosen from one of four general-purpose ranges ( 0_to_infty, 0_to_1,
centered_0, centered_1).
2Relevant functions in the documentation are isaacgym.gymapi.RigidBodyProperties, isaacgym.gymapi.RigidShapeProperties,
isaacgym.gymapi.Gym.get_actor_dof_properties(). Note that among these properties, there are a few fields that we found had no effect in
simulation. We discarded them for our domain randomization.

<!-- page:25 -->
D2. Cube Rotation
For the cube rotation task, we follow the training and deployment workflow outlined by the LeapHand authors. For training
all the policies, we use the same GRU architecture that receives 16 joint angles as input and outputs 16 target joint angles. We
also follow the LeapHand training code to randomize the initial pose of the hand and the size of the cube. When deploying
trained policies in the real world, the target joint angles are passed as position commands to a PID controller running at 20 Hz.
In addition to the initial pose of the hand and the size of the cube, the Human Designed policy is trained with DR in
object mass, object center of mass, hand friction, stiffness and damping. In DrEureka, we extend the simulation setup to
include additional domain randomization parameters, such as hand restitution, joint friction, armature, object friction and object
restitution. These parameters, along with the others, are detailed in Table XIII.
Property Valid Range RAPP Search Range
object mass [0 , ∞ ) [0 . 01 , 1]

D3. Globe Walking
For globe walking, we largely extend the framework from forward locomotion, with a few exceptions. First, the policy takes
in an additional yaw sensor as input. Second, to account for actuator inaccuracies in the real world, we use an actuator network
from Ji et al. [70]; this network is pretrained on log data to predict real robot torques from joint commands, and we use it to
compute torques from actions in simulation when training the quadruped. Third, we have additional domain randomization
parameters, shown in Table XIV.
In the real world, we deploy our quadruped on a 34-inch yoga ball. We did not have a stable pole to tether our quadruped,
so we instead resort to a human holding the end of the leash; however, we are careful to hold the leash parallel to the ground
to ensure that the human does not provide any upward force that might aid the robot, and our sole purpose is to keep the robot
within a safe radius.

E. Additional Ablation Results
Sampling from DrEureka priors enables stable simulation training. To better understand the drastically different
performances of different DrEureka prior choices in the real world, we present the simulation training curves in Figure 10.
Note that the performances are not directly comparable as each method is trained and evaluated on its own DR distributions.
Nevertheless, we observe the stable training progress of DrEureka. In contrast, despite using a LLM, the ablations synthesize
poor DR ranges, resulting in difficult policy training dynamics.
DrEureka does not need a reward curriculum. To study the effectiveness of the reward functions in isolation, we fix
the domain randomization configurations to be Human-Designed for both DrEureka and Human-Designed reward
functions and re-train several policies in simulation. Since Human-Designed reward utilizes a velocity curriculum, we also

evaluate an ablation of the Human-Designed reward function that has a fixed velocity target (i.e., 2.0 m/s) to put it on an
equal footing with the Eureka reward function as a standalone reward function. The training curves are shown in Figure 12. As
shown, DrEureka reward enables more sample-efficient training and reaches higher asymptotic performance. In contrast, the
Human-Designed reward crucially depends on the explicit curriculum to work comparably; as a stand-alone reward function
without curriculum inputs, Human-Designed makes little progress.
Safety instruction enables safe reward functions. In addition to comparing against human-written reward functions, we
also ablate DrEureka’s own reward design procedure. In particular, to verify that DrEureka’s safety instruction yields more
deployable reward functions, we compare to an ablation of DrEureka that does not include custom safety suggestions in the
prompt; see Table VI for the functional form of this reward function. Note that this ablation is identical to the original Eureka
algorithm in Table I, and we compare it to the DrEureka (No DR) variant to eliminate the influence of domain randomization
in policy performance. As shown in Table XVI, removing the safety prompt results in a final reward function that can move
faster in simulation than DrEureka. However, the robot acquires an unnatural gait with three of its feet and the hip dragging
on the ground. Consequently, in the real world, this behavior does not transfer, and the policy directly face-plants at the starting
line; this is not surprising as the Eureka reward function contains just a generic action smoothing term for safety, which in
itself does not prohibit awkward behaviors. Example snapshots are included in Figure 13; See our project website for a video
comparison.

F . CEM and BayRn Baseline Details
In this section, we detail our DR baseline procedure for Cross Entropy Method (CEM) [ 16, 66, 67] and Bayesian Optimization
(BayRn) [48, 68]. On a high level, both algorithms optimize DR parameters by repeatedly training and evaluating policies
in real. Over multiple iterations, CEM trains policies on DR configurations Ti, . . . ,Tj sampled from distribution p, evaluates
their real-world performance Ji, . . . , Jj, and updates p to fit the k "elite" samples with highest J. BayRn initially trains and
evaluates multiple sampled DR configurations T0, . . . ,Ti, then fits a surrogate model G on (T0, J0), . . . ,(Ti, Ji); next, for
multiple iterations, BayRn uses G and acquisition function a to select the next DR configuration Tj to train and evaluate, then
updates G with (Tj, Jj).
For BayRn, we select the widely used Matérn 2.5 kernel and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function
with parameter κ = 5 and ξ = 1. To maintain the same sample complexity of 16, we run CEM for 4 iterations with 4 samples
each and BayRn with 8 initial samples, then 8 iterations with 1 sample each.
